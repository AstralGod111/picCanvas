# Project - Fixed for cross-platform run

Changes made:
- Updated `scripts` in package.json to use `cross-env` for cross-platform environment variables.
- Added `cross-env` to `devDependencies`.
- Created this README with instructions.

How to run locally (Linux / macOS / Windows PowerShell / CMD):
1. Ensure Node.js (v18 or newer) and npm are installed.
2. In the project root:
   ```bash
   npm ci
   # or if you use npm install:
   npm install
   ```
3. Run in development mode:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   This runs the server with tsx and the Vite client in dev mode.
4. To build and run production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm start
   ```

Notes & troubleshooting:
- If you get errors about missing `tsx`, `vite`, or other tools, run `npm ci` to install devDependencies.
- If on Windows and you still get env issues, ensure you're running in PowerShell or CMD; cross-env should handle it.
- If the project expects `bun` or `pnpm`, you can also use those package managers; package-lock may not exist.
- If the server fails to start due to a missing database or environment variables, check `.env` and provide required vars (none required for in-memory storage).

If you'd like, I can:
- Create a patch listing changed files.
- Attempt to run `npm ci` and `npm run dev` inside a container if you provide a dev environment with Node installed.
